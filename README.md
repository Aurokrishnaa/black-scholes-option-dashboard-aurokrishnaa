##  Real World Test Case: AAPL Call Option (August 2025)

To demonstrate the practical application of this dashboard, I tested it using a real European-style option on **Apple Inc. (AAPL)** from August 2025. The parameters were sourced from actual option chain data.

| Parameter              | Value                        |
|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Underlying Price (S)   | $196.25                      |
| Strike Price (K)       | $195.00                      |
| Expiry Date            | August 9, 2025               |
| Evaluation Date        | August 3, 2025               |
| Time to Maturity (T)   | 6/365 ≈ **0.0164 years**     |
| Implied Volatility (σ) | ~22% → **0.22**              |
| Risk-Free Rate (r)     | **5%**                       |
| Market Option Price    | **$2.25**                    |
| Purchase Price (P₀)    | **$2.00** (for P&L testing)  |

This example validates that the Black-Scholes output aligns closely with market pricing and allows for robust **P&L analysis**, **Greeks interpretation**, and **sensitivity visualization** using real financial data.

> A great showcase of how this dashboard can assist in **option valuation, strategy development**, and **financial modeling interviews**.
